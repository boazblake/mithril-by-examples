Mithril by Examples was created for (me and) new users to learn mithril.js ‚Äî a javascript framework for building brilliant applications.

This website is just a wrapper for the wonderful [Flems](https://flems.io) - a static browser code playground - and contains code samples that can be seen, reviewed and run.

The code snippets listed on this website are up-to-date, and they just work.
