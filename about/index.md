Mithril by Examples was created for (me and) new users to learn mithril.js â€” a javascript framework for building brilliant applications.

This website is just a wrapper for the wonderful [Flems](https://flems.io) - a static browser code playground - and contains code samples that can be seen, reviewed and run.

The code snippets listed here are up-to-date, and they just work!

## Contributors

The project could not exist without [the many contributors]({{ '/contributors/' | url }}), who spent hours creating their code examples and making them available here.

## Me

The website was created by [Thomas Breuss](https://www.tebe.ch).
It was built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), a simple static site generator, together with a few other things.
