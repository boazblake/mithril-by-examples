# Mithril by Examples

> The missing addition to Mithril.js website with many up-to-date code examples that are often searched for and that just work...

## What is this?

`Mithril by Examples` was created for (me and) new users to learn Mithril.js â€” a javascript framework for building brilliant applications.

This website is simply a wrapper for the wonderful [Flems](https://flems.io) - a static browser code playground - and contains code samples that can be seen, reviewed and run.

The code snippets are up-to-date, and they just work!
